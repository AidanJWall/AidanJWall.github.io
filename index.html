        	Since my last status update, my code has changed quite dramatically. Instead of just using if statements to control the character’s walk/run etc. I began using Booleans and switches. For example, a Boolean called walkLeft, which was set to false by default, and the character could only walk left if it was set to true.
		<br/>
Originally, I made this change to try to get rid of the keyboard delay and also to allow the character to run using shift. I managed to succeed at the former, but the latter still wouldn’t work for me so I’m still using the A and D keys for now. I also got rid of the switches and used if statements, but kept the Booleans.
		<br/>
Next, I managed to simulate an endless loop of the background using collision detection. The character collides with a point at the edge and every layer in the background shifts to its own specified x value. 
		<br/>
After an unsuccessful attempt at including a jump cycle I animated, I made an animation of a spaceship flying across the scene. This would become 3 spaceships, all flying at different times with their own sound effects.
		<br/>
I included more collision detection that would have the character stop at a button until the L key was pressed, which would play the spaceship animation, but I later decided to have a giant hangar door open to reveal the spaceships instead. I also added a bit of music to play after this happens.
		<br/>
Next, I inked up a female character in Illustrator and included her in the scene. Dick Dynamite collides with her and faces the camera with a shocked expression because he fancies her or something, I don’t know. I’ll add a bit more to it eventually.
		<br/>
Finally, I added sound effects to the fla file, for the footsteps, ships and the big door opening.
